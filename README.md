# Project Introduction
HabitNest is a web-based platform designed to enhance productivity and personal growth through habit tracking and community support. Users can create accounts to set personal goals, track their progress in developing new habits, and participate in community challenges. Habitat fosters a supportive network where users can share tips, celebrate achievements, and find motivation in a like-minded community.  
## Key features
- User account creation and management: Secure login and personal dashboard customization.
- Habit tracking: Users can create, manage, and track daily habits with progress visualization (e.g., streaks, graphs).
- Community challenges: Users can join or create challenges related to common goals, such as "30 days of fitness" or "daily meditation," and track collective progress.
- Reward system: Points or badges awarded for consistency and participation in community goals.
- Social interaction: Users can follow each other, share progress, and send encouragement.
